# Death-Age-Difference-of-Right-Handers-with-Left-Handers-Project
Analysis of Death Age Difference of Right-Handers with Left Handers

In this project, we will investigate the claim that left-handed individuals tend to die at a younger age than right-handed individuals. To explore this phenomenon, we will use age distribution data and employ Bayesian statistics to analyze the probability of different ages at death based on whether an individual is reported as left-handed or right-handed.

We will utilize Python's powerful data manipulation library, pandas, to work with the data and create insightful visualizations using matplotlib. Additionally, we will leverage numpy arrays for numerical computations and construct probabilities from frequency data.

The objective is to examine if there is any evidence to support the assertion that left-handed people have a shorter lifespan compared to their right-handed counterparts. By using Bayesian statistics, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of this claim and whether it holds true in light of the changing rates of left-handedness over time.

To participate in this project, a solid understanding of concepts from pandas Foundations, Statistical Thinking in Python, and Introduction to Data Visualization with Python is recommended. These skills will be essential in performing data analysis and interpreting the results effectively.
